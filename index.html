<p1> As you can see the combos for Roy is less hits in his combos because Roy is to have less hits in his combos but have more damage but with mario it is the opposite. This game combat system is amazing but very had to link in to true combos. this is because of the ariels and grounds moves and each move could have a differant kind of effect like spike or lots of knockback or none. And there is no health bar but percent. the idea of the game is to knock off the stage and you do this but attacking and racking up there percentge then using smash attacks to knock them of to get a stock or life to win.</P1>
